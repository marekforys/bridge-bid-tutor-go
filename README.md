- When it's your turn, enter your bid:
  - To bid: Enter the level followed by the suit (e.g., `1H`, `2NT`, `3C`)
  - To pass: Type `pass` or `p`
  - To double: Type `double`, `dbl`, or `x`
  - To redouble: Type `redouble`, `rdbl`, or `xx`

## Bidding Conventions

The AI uses a simple bidding system:
- 20+ HCP: Open 2â™£ (strong hand)
- 15-19 HCP: Open 1 of a suit (longest suit)
- < 15 HCP: Pass
